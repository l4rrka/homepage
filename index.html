      <p>Hey everyone! My name is Valerie and I’m an eighteen-year-old student, currently residing in  Northern Ireland. I was born and raised in Ukraine and, as it is fair to suggest, my life has been complicated by wars and runaways. This led to my family changing places of residence five times in the last ten years, which also affected my education. Due to a shift in Ukrainian and Northern Ireland curriculums, I am still studying at school and going to graduate in 2026 (when all my peers from Ukraine will have already finished their third year of university!). But I cannot and will not complain: I consider changes as motivation for progress, and all my experience, including the last 3 years in NI, have shaped me and let me find my peace of mind. In this experimental website, I would like you to dive a little deeper into my life and discover me as an individual. And I think there is nothing better to present myself than my very own poetry - we will explore four poems from different periods of my life, and I will try to reflect on how they portrayed the former Valerie. </p>

      <p>Apart from being a TikTok addict and a designated procrastinator, one of my hobbies has always been drawing and design. To say that I engage in it frequently, or even occasionally, is, frankly, an overstatement. But it has always been there, as a good old friend, reflecting my attention to detail, perfectionism, and love of aesthetics. It clearly impacted my career choice, and when I’m in a silly mood, I like to say that choosing Art & Design for GCSE led me to abandoning my graphic designer career plans and focusing on programming. But there is just something special about computer science – something that I’ve never felt about design, or illustration, or any other profession I used to consider. </p>

      <p>My first programming encounter was at the age of ten, when I was first introduced to HTML by our IT teacher. It didn’t make much of a change at the time, apart from me being able to ask my mum to make tea via a specially created webpage. But looking back, programming and computer science had always been around and were expressed in my thrivingness in mathematics, project management, or design. I just couldn’t find a match which would unite those interests; but now, I feel I found the one. The crucial decision I made back in my first GCSE year was choosing Digital Technology as one of my subjects. Our essential coursework had to be an extensive program written in Python, and once I got my hands on the task I naturally flourished in it. I couldn’t stop coding – it was just something I was meant to be doing. It involved problem solving, logical thinking, management, design, self-improvement – all the bits and pieces I hadn’t previously been able to fuse together. Programming gives me a sense of satisfaction and I believe I can do more with it. It feeds my intellectual curiosity and makes me feel I still have a mountain of things to learn– and I enjoy it. The technological sphere grows every day and I am growing with it, hoping that one day my contributions will eventually leave a vague footprint on its ground.</p>
