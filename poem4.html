        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <p>I’d like to draw conclusions about my development with this last poem. It was written on the 16th November 2024, when I hadn’t already been writing poems for about a year. The secret to my lack of motivation was that I became stronger and healthier - I no longer have to express my emotions during crying nights or hysterics because of my looks or relationships. However, this poem is something different - it is a reflection on the past, not the present. When you’re cut out from your home country and forced to be pasted into a completely different picture, you feel regret. Regret for what you have or haven’t done and could or couldn’t do. This poem is an acknowledgement that things have changed and I will never come back to where I was extracted from. It’s easy to look back and judge what you should’ve done differently - for example, if I were to choose I would have never let myself lose all the friends in 2021. I would have instead saturated myself with them just so that I wouldn't blame myself for being so reluctant to enjoy my teenage years. The problem is that such thoughts only make it worse and force you to focus on the past rather than the future. This poem says goodbye to the unfair griefs and worries, and lets my eyes look forward with awe, not despair.</p>

        <p class='poem'>
          The mistakes of the past, so calm through the years,<br>
          Return to me, then vanish in my fears.<br>
          They sneak up slyly, too assured, too near,<br>
          The night plays cruel tricks, whispers in my ear.<br><br>

          And thoughts, like trains that know no end,<br>
          Carry me back through time, to where they bend.<br>
          I look with awe, as if in divine grace,<br>
          At things that’ll never again find their place.<br><br>

          At times, I forget, though it’s never my will,<br>
          The words once spoken, lost, distant, still.<br>
          I turn in confusion, staring ahead—<br>
          Who am I now? Where am I led?<br><br>

          No one will return the joy of the past,<br>
          No one will carry me through cities so vast.<br>
          I missed my moment, and now it’s all gone—<br>
          The road is lost, the footprints long withdrawn.<br><br>

          All the trains have left. The cars rushing by,<br>
          With swift, relentless speed beneath the sky.<br>
          I stand alone. To run is but a lie;<br>
          All the lights have gone dark, and I wonder why.<br><br>

          I might be a star, flying far and wide,<br>
          Drifting into the unknown, without guide.<br>
          But in the flight, one truth must always burn:<br>
          There’s no way back—no place to return.<br><br>

          I walk like a ghost through places long past,<br>
          Unable to believe I was there, so fast.<br>
          The night slips on. I lose the thoughts I’d kept,<br>
          And come back to routine, as if by habit, swept.
